## Work distribution:

Khaled and Mohammed can upload HTML, CSS, and JS files into static.
Alaa will integrate their work into react.

Please go to `static/styles.css` and view the `:root` which defines CSS variables. The variables are used so that we can change the styles in one place if we want to instead of changing multiple places. An example of how to use the variables is provided in the same file for `h1`.
