# Takaful Club
This repositery contains the front end to the takaful club project.


## To Run:

You can access the fornt at [takaful-club](https://takaful-club.netlify.app/programs), however, you need to run the [backend](https://github.com/Alaeddin03/api.project.web) on your localhost since it is not deployed to a server yet.

You need to have Node js installed in order to run the page.

After cloning the repo, type the following commands in the terminal:
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
Whenever you need to run it again (other than the first time), just tyoe `npm run dev`.

Note that for the APIs to actually work, you need to run the back end code first. 
The back end is found [here](https://github.com/Alaeddin03/api.project.web).

Then naviagte to `http://localhost:5173/`.
